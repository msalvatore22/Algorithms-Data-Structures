# What is an algorithm
* A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

## Why are they imporant?
* Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm. It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver.

## How do you improve?
* Devise a plan for solving problems
* Master common problem solving patterns

# Problem Solving Gameplan
* Understand the problem
* Explore Concrete Examples
* Break It Down
* Solve/Simplify
* Look Back and Refactor

## Understand the Problem
* Can I restate the problem in my own words?
* What are the inputs that go into the problem?
* What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem.
* Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
* How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Explore Concrete Examples
* Start with Simple Examples
* Progress to more Complex Cases
* Explore Examples with empty inputs
* Explore Examples with invalid inputs

## Break It Down
* Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

## Solve / Simplify
* Solve the problem if you can
* If you can't, solve a simpler problem
* Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
* Temporarily ignore that difficulty
* Write a simplified solution
* Then incorporate that difficulty back in

## Look back and Refactor
### Refactoring Questions
* Can I check the result?
* Can I derive the result differently?
* Can I understand it at a glance?
* Can I use the result or method for some other problem?
* Can I improve the performance of the solution?
* Can I think of other ways to refactor?
* How have other people solved this problem?
