# Problem Solving Patterns

## Some Common Algorithm Patterns
* Frequency Counter
* Multiple Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Divide and Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Backtracking

### Frequency Counter
* This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frquencies of values
* Often used when comparing multiple inputs of data
* This can often avoid the need to use nested loops (O(N^2)) operations with arrays and strings

### Multiple Pointers
* Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index position and move towards the beginning, end , or middle based on a certain condition
* Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

### Sliding Window
* This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
* Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
* Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

### Divide and Conquer
* This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.
* This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.
* Binary Search
