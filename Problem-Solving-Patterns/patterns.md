# Problem Solving Patterns

## Some Common Algorithm Patterns
* Frequency Counter
* Multiple Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Divide and Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Backtracking

### Frequency Counter
* This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frquencies of values
* Often used when comparing multiple inputs of data
* This can often avoid the need to use nested loops (O(N^2)) operations with arrays and strings

### Multiple Pointers
* Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index position and move towards the beginning, end , or middle based on a certain condition
* Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
